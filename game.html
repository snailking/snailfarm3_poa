			<a name="quickstart"><h2 align="center">GAME INFO</h2></a>
			<div class="container-beige">		
				<p><b>SnailFarm</b> is an idlegame played in rounds. The goal is to be the first to reach <b>1 million Snails</b>. Once you hatch enough snails to get to that number, you win the round and receive the current pot.</p><br>
				<p>At the end of the round, <b>all Snails and Eggs are wiped</b>, including market Eggs, and the game starts anew 12 hours later.</p><br>
			</div>
			<div class="container-beige">
					<p>To get started, you must first buy starting Snails. This one-time transaction will allow you to play <b>every</b> round, which you can join at your convenience.</p><br>
					<p>Your Snails continuously <b>lay Eggs</b>, which you can hatch into even more Snails for a slight, fixed POA cost. Each Egg can hatch into <b>more than one Snail</b>: the more Boosts you have, the more Snails per Egg.</p><br>
					<p>Eggs can be <b>bought and sold directly from the smart contract</b>. The price of Eggs <b>vary widely</b> based on the current supply of Eggs and the eggpot. If the eggpot has a lot of POA but the market holds very few Eggs, it's time to sell. On the contrary, if the eggpot has little POA but the market is filled with Eggs, it's a good opportunity to buy.</p><br>
			</div>
			<div class="container-beige">		
					<p>There is a special type of eggs: Red Eggs. Unlike normal Eggs and Snails, <b>Red Eggs carry over</b> from round to round. At the end of each round, players who didn't win receive <b>1 Red Egg for every 100 Snails</b> they own.</p><br>
					<p>During rounds, the Red Harvest is another way to get Red Eggs. The Red Harvest puts <b>300 Red Eggs</b> for auction at an POA price starting high and <b>decreasing with time</b>.</p><br>
			</div>
			<div class="container-beige">		
					<p>Hatch Boosts exist in two kinds: Food, and Friends. You can only hold one of each particular boost. Both kind of Boosts give the same increase in hatch size: <b>+1 boost = +1 snail</b> per egg.</p><br>
					<p>Food Boosts are <b>your own</b>. These boosts are Lettuce, Carrot and Slug. They cost a certain amount of resources, and last for a number of rounds before disappearing.</p><br>
					<p>Friend Boosts are competitive: <b>only one player can own a specific friend boost</b> at a time.These boosts are the SpiderQueen, the SquirrelDuke and the TadpolePrince. Each Friend flip <b>increases the requirement</b> to get that boost. It is possible for a single player to hold several different Friends at once.</p><br>
			</div>
			<div class="container-beige">		
					<p>Through the Poatree, players can <b>invest in the bankroll</b> of the game itself. Funding the Tree with POA gives a number of acorns in return. <b>10% of all POA spent</b> on the game is distributed between Acorn holders.</p><br>
					<p>Before the game starts for the first time, acorns are at <b>half price</b>. After that, their price lowers slightly with every round. Like Red Eggs, <b>Acorns carry over between rounds</b>. Acorns cannot be sold. Funding the game means <b>receiving dividends eternally</b>, although the price decrease ensures a dilution of investor shares to encourage newcomers.</p><br>
			</div>
			<div class="container-beige">		
					<p>While the POA version of SnailFarm isn't part of it, a whole ecosystem of Ethereum Snail games exist. Amongst them is a master game called "SnailThrone", where holders are entitled to part of the ETH spent everywhere else. Check out SnailThrone if you want to know more: <a href="https://snailking.github.io/snailthrone/" target="_blank">https://snailking.github.io/snailthrone/</a></p><br>

		<!-- GAME MECHANICS -->
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<h2 align="center">GAME MECHANICS</h2><br>
			<h3>ROUNDS</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>The jackpot for a round amounts to 10% of the Snailpot. This percentage is set when the round is initialized, so it doesn't change thorough the round.</p>
				<p>Rounds have no time limit and last until a player reaches 1M snails.</p>
				<p>After a round is won, the game undergoes a 24h downtime as to give everyone a fair chance to be ready for the next start.</p>
				<p>Once the timer hits 0, any player can start the round by clicking the button that will appear right under game status.</p>
				<p>Players who want to join a new round also need to click a button that will appear at that same position.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>SNAILS</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>Players start with 300 Snails after buying their starting Snails. These starting Snails cost 0.04 POA.</p>
				<p>Snails lay Eggs at a rate of 1 per Snail per day. 300 Snails = 300 Eggs in 24 hours.</p>
				<p>Snails cannot produce more Eggs than their numbers. Hatch at least once a day, if you don't want to waste potential Eggs.</p>
				<p>Hatching costs 0.008 POA. If the hatch transaction results in 1M snails or more, the player wins the round.</p>
				<p>Snail count is reset to 0 at the end of a round. Joining a new round will give players 300 Snails again.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>EGGS</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>Eggs can be bought from the smart contract with the following formula: POA spent / (POA spent + eggpot) * marketegg</p>
				<p>This means there are diminishing returns, with smaller buys getting proportionally more eggs.</p>
				<p>No more than 10% of the Egg supply can be bought at once. If a player spends more than the maximum buy, this POA is refunded to the player balance.</p>
				<p>Eggs bought don't interfere with the maximum amount of Eggs Snails can lay. If you have 300 Snails and 100 Eggs (leaving you 200 potential Eggs) and buy 400 Eggs, your Snails can still lay 200 more Eggs, bringing you to a total of 700.</p>
				<p>Eggs can be sold to the smart contract with the following formula: POA = (eggs / (eggs + marketeggs)) * eggpot / 2</p>
				<p>Like with buying, there are diminishing returns. The less eggs sold, the more POA per eggs.</p>
				<p>Eggs are sold all at once, but no more than 1/10 of the supply can be sold at once. This makes the maximum reward about half of the eggpot.</p>
				<p>Sell early and sell often!</p>
			</div>
			<h3>RED EGGS</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>Once they join a new round, players receive 1 Red Egg for the square root of their Snails.</p>
				<p>(If you have 300 Snails at the end of a round, the square root of 300 is 17, and so you get 17 Reds.)</p>
				<p>Red Eggs can be hatched at no cost. However, their main utility are to claim various Boosts or the Snailmaster position itself.</p>
				<p>Red Eggs benefit from Hatch Boosts the same way as normal Eggs.</p>
				<p>While Red Eggs cannot be sold, they can be bought through the Red Harvest. The Red Harvest puts 100 Red Eggs for sale, for 1/4th to the Round jackpot.</p>
				<p>This price then decreases all the way to 0.02 POA, over a period of 1 hour. This price decrease is sharp at first, then slower. The exact formula is: basePrice - maximumPriceChange * squareRootTimeElapsed / squareRoot1Hour</p>
				<p>Once a player grabs a Red Harvest, another one immediately starts at the original price (1/4 round jackpot).</p>
			</div>
			<h3>FOOD</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>The Lettuce lasts one round. Lettuces initially cost 20 Red Eggs * Round Number. This requirement then decreases by 20 for every Lettuce bought, down to a minimum of 20.</p>
				<p>Example: we're on Round 3, nobody has bought any Lettuce yet. The price of a Lettuce will be 20 * 3 = 60 Red Eggs. Once a player buys a Lettuce, the next Lettuce will cost 40 Red Eggs.</p>
				<p>The Carrot lasts three rounds. Carrots have a fixed price of 0.2 POA.</p>
				<p>The Slug is permanent. Slugs require a sacrifice of all the Snails the player own, and the minimum amount of Snails required is 100 000.</p>
				<p>The Slug should be seen as a longterm play, giving up on a round in order to gain a significant advantage in further rounds.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>FRIENDS</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>The requirement for Friends increases with every flip, and resets at the beginning of each new round.</p>
				<p>The SpiderQueen costs 80 Snails. This requirement doubles with every flip.</p>
				<p>The SquirrelDuke costs 2 Red Eggs. This requirement doubles with every flip.</p>
				<p>The TadpolePrince costs 0.2 POA. This requirement increases by 20% with every flip. On the next flip, the Tadpole owner will receive 110% of the POA he spent.</p>
				<p>Players can specify a higher amount of POA than strictly required, in order to ensure they get the Tadpole through several flips. Any POA over the requirement will be refunded to the player balance.</p>
				<p>The Slug should be seen as a longterm play, giving up on a round in order to gain a significant advantage in further rounds.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>ACORNS</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>Acorn price is set at 0.01 POA, and decreases according to the following formula: 10/ (10 + Round)</p>
				<p>This means on Round 1, the price for 1 Acorn will be 0.01 * 10 / 11 ~= 0.00909 POA. On Round 10, the price for 1 Acorn will be 0.01 * 10 / 20 = 0.005 POA.</p>
				<p>Acorns cannot be sold. Acorn holders earn dividends forever. Being early is advantageous, however it is balanced by potential share dilution due to the decreasing cost.</p>
				<p>Round 0 offers Acorns at half price (0.005 POA), in order to incentivize an early bankroll funding.</p>
				<p>Acorn holders receive 20% of all POA spent on the game save for the Tadpole, twice as much as in the original SnailFarm!</p>
			</div>
			<h3>POT SPLIT</h3>
			<div class="container-beige">
				<p>Incoming POA of each transaction is distributed as follows:</p>
				<p>- 40% to the Snailpot</p>
				<p>- 40% to the Eggpot</p>
				<p>- 20% in dividends to Acorn holders</p>
